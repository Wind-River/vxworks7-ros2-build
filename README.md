VxWorks® 7 ROS2 Build Scripts
===
---

# Overview

The VxWorks 7 ROS2 Build Scripts provide build scripts to automate building
ROS2 with a VxWorks SDK.

The Robot Operating System 2 is a set of software libraries and tools that
aid in building robot applications. ROS2 is a re-architecture of the
framework to include support for new use cases.

These new use cases include:
* Teams of multiple robots
* Small embedded platforms
* Real-time systems
* Non-ideal networks
* Production environment
* Design patterns for building and structuring systems


The default configuration build configuration will build a minimal set of
ROS2 packages necessary for running the example applications.

This configuration is suited for prototyping and personal
use.  Please refer to the details of each individual ROS2 package for details
on what requirements and terms of use they may have.

*NOTE*: ROS2 is not part of any VxWorks® product. If you need help,
use the resources available or contact your Wind River sales representative
to arrange for consulting services.

# Prerequisite(s)

* Download a VxWorks Software Development Kit from Wind River Labs
   * https://labs.windriver.com/downloads/wrsdk.html

* The build system will need to download source code from github.com and bitbucket.org.  A
  working Internet connection with access to both sites is required.

For the standard build you must also have:

* Supported Linux host for both ROS2 and VxWorks 7
   * ROS 2.0 Target Platforms
      * http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html
   * VxWorks 7 SR0640
      * https://docs.windriver.com/bundle/vxworks_7_release_notes_sr0640/page/bym1551818657142.html
   * For ROS2 Dashing Diademata, Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) 64-bit LTS is the Tier 1 host
* Install the development tools and ROS tools from “Building ROS 2 on Linux”
   * https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Linux-Development-Setup/
* Install the “Required Linux Host OS Packages”  for VxWorks 7
   * https://docs.windriver.com/bundle/2020_03_Workbench_Release_Notes_SR0640_1/page/age1436590316395.html
* Mercurial (hg) package for Eigen (optional)

## Directory Structure
Packages
```
├── Docker
├── Makefile
├── pkg
│   ├── asio
│   ├── ros2
│   ├── tinyxml2
│   ├── turtlebot3
│   └── unixextra
```
It uses Makefile to invoke ros2 and turtlebot3 colcon build, and also build some dependencies.
A Docker (Ubuntu 18.04) based build is used to avoid a necessity for installing build dependencies.
Build Artifacs
```
├── build     - pkg build artifacts
├── downloads - download arctifacts
├── export    - a ready-to-deploy filesystem with ROS2 libraries and binaries
``` 

## ROS2 VxWorks patches
ROS2 patches for VxWorks are located in the separate repository
https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-layer-for-ros2

It is cloned during the build to the *patches* dir
```
├── pkg
│   ├── ros2
│   │   ├── patches

```
## Build VxWorks 7 and ROS2

Clone this repository using the master branch
```
git clone https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-ros2-build.git
cd vxworks7-ros2-build
```

Build Docker image
```
cd Docker/vxbuild
docker build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) -t vxbuild:1.0 .
cd Docker/vxros2build
docker build -t vxros2build:1.0 .
```

Download the VxWorks SDK for IA - UP Squared from https://labs.windriver.com/downloads/wrsdk.html
```
wget https://labs.windriver.com/downloads/wrsdk-vxworks7-up2-1.6.tar.bz2
```

Extract the VxWorks SDK tarball
```
tar –jxvf wrsdk-vxworks7-up2-1.6.tar.bz2
```

Run Docker image
```
cd vxworks7-ros2-build
docker run -ti -v <path-to-the-wrsdk>:/wrsdk -v $PWD:/work vxros2build:1.0
```

Inside Docker container: Source the development environment
```
wruser@d19165730517:/work source /wrsdk/toolkit/wind_sdk_env.linux
```

Inside Docker container: Run make to build ROS2 using the SDK
```
wruser@d19165730517:/work make
```

Buid artifacts are in export directory
```
wruser@d19165730517:/work ls export/root/
include  lib  llvm
```

Rebuild from scratch
```
wruser@d19165730517:/work make distclean
wruser@d19165730517:/work make
```

## Run ROS2 examples

Run QEMU
```
sudo apt-get install uml-utilities
sudo tunctl -u $USER -t tap0
sudo ifconfig tap0 192.168.200.254 up

cd vxworks7-ros2-build
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512M  -kernel $WIND_SDK_TOOLKIT/../bsps/itl_generic_2_0_2_1/boot/vxWorks -net nic  -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no -display none -serial stdio -monitor none -append "bootline:fs(0,0)host:vxWorks h=192.168.200.254 e=192.168.200.1 u=target pw=boot o=gei0" -usb -device usb-ehci,id=ehci  -device usb-storage,drive=fat32 -drive file=fat:ro:./export/root,id=fat32,format=raw,if=none
